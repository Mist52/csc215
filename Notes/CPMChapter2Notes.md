# Chapter 2 Notes

## Introduction
 - 
 -  Core memory can retain its contents even with power off. (A programming error could wipe the memory)
 - Semiconductor memory replaced Core memory. Semiconductor RAM loses its memory when the
power goes down. 


## Firmware Monitor 
- When a microproccessor is reset it begins operation by fetching an instruction from
memory location zero.
 - 


## The Operating System
 - CP/M is highly adaptable and has been implemented on a wide range of computers from different manufacturers.
 - Unlike some other computer components, I/O port assignments (addresses and busy bit configurations) are not standardized across different computer systems.
 - To send characters to a console, a driver program must check the status of the output port and wait for it to be ready, then output the character.
 - Embedding hardware-specific drivers in programs restricts their portability.
 - CP/M simplifies operations by handling details of disk accesses and I/O ports, making assembly language programs "hardware independent" and portable.
