# Introduction and Preface Notes from CPM Assembly Language Programming

## Overall Themes
 - Assembly Language Still Relevant: Despite higher-level languages, assembly language remains important for:
   - Hardware interfacing.
   - Size and time critical applications.
   - Dedicated controllers.
 - CP/M Operating System Simplifies Learning: CP/M allows assembly language programs to be more "hardware independent" and portable.
 - Integrated Learning: The book aims to integrate learning assembly language with understanding computer hardware.


## Key Concepts

 - Assembly Language:
   - Forces the programmer to think like the machine.
   - Requires knowledge of hardware organization.
   - Uses mnemonics to represent machine instructions (e.g., JMP for jump).
 - CP/M (Control Program/Microcomputer):
   - A standard operating system that simplifies assembly programming.
   - Provides facilities for I/O and mass storage.
   - Makes different computers appear more similar.
 - Portability: CP/M allows assembly programs to be more portable across different hardware.
 - Assembly Process:
   - Edit: Create the source code.
   - Assemble: Translate the assembly code into machine code.
   - Debug: Find and fix errors in the program.
 - Tools:
   - CP/M operating system.
   - Manual set for CP/M.
   - 8080/8085 Assembly Language Programming Manual (Intel).
   - Editor (e.g., ED.COM).
   - Assembler (e.g., ASM.COM).
   - Debugger (e.g., DDT).
 - DDT (Dynamic Debugging Tool):
   - A CP/M tool for entering and executing machine language programs directly.
   - Can be used to test parts of a computer.
 - Importance of Mnemonics and Labels: Mnemonics make the code easier to read, while labels make it more understandable.
