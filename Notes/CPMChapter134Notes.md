# The Operator's Consle
 - Early Consoles: Earliest computers used lights, switches, and patch cords for operator communication and program input.
 - The ASR-33 became the standard computer terminal due to its low cost, robustness, and integrated paper tape punch/reader.
 - The term "console" originally referred to the switches-and-lights interface but transitioned to encompass terminal devices as user interaction moved away from direct hardware manipulation.
 - Before floppy disks, the TTY's paper tape punch and reader provided the primary means of program and data storage for smaller computers.
 - The microprocessor enabled the development of inexpensive CRT terminals, replacing the TTY's mechanical keyboard and printer.
 - CRT terminals offered silent operation and replaced paper tape with the floppy disk for more reliable storage.
 - While CRTs provided many benefits, the author reminisces about the tangible record of activity that paper tape provided for debugging.

# The Computer

 - Computers can come in many different sizes from giant servers through computers down to small microcumputers.
 - Every computer ends up having a CPU or Central Proccesing Unit inside of it.
 - It was named at the time this because it was a seperate rack filled with circuit boards. Another rack was needed to hold all of the memory for the computer.
 - As technology advanced, you could package a complete computer into a small hand held device.
 - The CPU is part of a computer system responsible for all data manipulation.
 - Regardless of physical form, the CPU performs the core processing tasks, reciving data, processing it, and potentially transferring it elsewhere.
