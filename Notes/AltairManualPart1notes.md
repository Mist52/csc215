# A. LOGIC

- Nineteenth century mathematician George Boole studied logical expressions and numeric operations.
- He published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic in 1847 and a detailed work in 1854.
- Modern digital computers use Booleâ€™s logic ideas.

- Boolean algebra treats logic statements as true or false.
- It rejects partial truth or doubt.
- Electronic circuits use two states.
- ON state equals true.
- OFF state equals false.

- You can model logic in circuits with on-off switches.
- OFF passes no current. It equals 0.
- ON passes current. It equals 1.

- You can build AND, OR, NOT logic with switches or circuits:

  Conditions   Result
  0 AND 0      0
  0 AND 1      0
  1 AND 0      0
  1 AND 1      1

- The logic follows truth tables.
- AND returns true only when all inputs are true.
- OR returns true when at least one input is true.
- NOT reverses logic: true becomes false, false becomes true.


## B. Electronic Logic
- Gates implemented with transistor circuits.
- Symbols exist for AND, OR, NOT.
- NAND and NOR combine basic gates.
- XOR (exclusive-OR) adds input bits.
- Flip-flops built from NAND gates provide memory.
- Monostable and astable circuits manage timing and switching.

# C. NUMBER SYSTEMS

- Ancient humans used fingers to count. That gave us ten digits.
- Number systems can use any digit count.
- Electronic circuits use two states so they match a two-digit system.
- You call the two digits bits in binary.
- Systems using eight or sixteen digits work well for complex logic systems.
- You use them to shorten long binary numbers.

# D. THE BINARY SYSTEM

- The computer processes nearly all operations in binary.
- A typical binary number has eight bits.
- You call a fixed length binary number a word or a byte.
- The computer processes and stores words.
- A binary word like 10111010 may seem meaningless.
- Binary uses only two digits.
- Binary works simpler than decimal.
- You derive binary for decimals 0 to 20 by adding one each time.
- You start at 0.
- Decimal 0 equals binary 0.
- Decimal 1 equals binary 1.
- You run out of digits, so start a new column at 2.
- Decimal 2 equals binary 10.
- Decimal 3 equals binary 11.
- You add a third column for decimal 4.
- Decimal 4 equals binary 100.
- You continue this up to 20.



- You convert binary to decimal by summing powers of two.
- Each bit shows a power of two.
- For example binary 10011 equals:
  1 times 2 raised to the fourth power
  plus 0 times 2 raised to the third power
  plus 0 times 2 raised to the second power
  plus 1 times 2 raised to the first power
  plus 1 times 2 raised to the zeroth power
- That equals 16 plus 0 plus 0 plus 2 plus 1
- That equals decimal 19
