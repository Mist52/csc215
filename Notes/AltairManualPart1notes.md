# A. LOGIC

- Nineteenth century mathematician George Boole studied logical expressions and numeric operations.
- He published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic in 1847 and a detailed work in 1854.
- Modern digital computers use Booleâ€™s logic ideas.

- Boolean algebra treats logic statements as true or false.
- It rejects partial truth or doubt.
- Electronic circuits use two states.
- ON state equals true.
- OFF state equals false.

- You can model logic in circuits with on-off switches.
- OFF passes no current. It equals 0.
- ON passes current. It equals 1.

- You can build AND, OR, NOT logic with switches or circuits:

  Conditions   Result
  0 AND 0      0
  0 AND 1      0
  1 AND 0      0
  1 AND 1      1

- The logic follows truth tables.
- AND returns true only when all inputs are true.
- OR returns true when at least one input is true.
- NOT reverses logic: true becomes false, false becomes true.


## B. Electronic Logic
- Gates implemented with transistor circuits.
- Symbols exist for AND, OR, NOT.
- NAND and NOR combine basic gates.
- XOR (exclusive-OR) adds input bits.
- Flip-flops built from NAND gates provide memory.
- Monostable and astable circuits manage timing and switching.
